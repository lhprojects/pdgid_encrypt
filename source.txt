The Monte Carlo particle numbering scheme presented here is
intended to facilitate interfacing between event generators, detector
simulators, and analysis packages used in particle physics. The
numbering scheme was introduced in 1988 [1] and a revised
version [2,3] was adopted in 1998 in order to allow systematic inclusion
of quark model states which are as yet undiscovered and hypothetical
particles such as SUSY particles. The numbering scheme is used in
several event generators, e.g. HERWIG and PYTHIA/JETSET, and
in the /HEPEVT/ [4] standard interface.
